    <p>My name is Benjam√≠n Silva, I studied Computer Science. I try to keep up to date on technologies and best practices and this blog is a personal project that hopefully helps me on that. I believe making myself write tech stuff is a good way to share my knowledge at the same time keep me learning new things.</p>
    <p>What I'm using on my daily work: Elixir (and Phoenix), Ruby on Rails, Rspec, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, Elasticsearch, AWS, Docker</p>
    <p>What else I know or I used before: Android Native, React, Python Django</p>
    <p>What do I want to learn in the next 3 months: Flutter and more about Elixir.</p>
